Clock in and out :
  - Output :
      [startTime - endTime]
      Some stuff at the start time.
      --// End Log //--
      Some notes at the end time.
      [startTime - *]
      Some stuff at the start time.
  - File Format :
      START: Time
      Some notes.
      END: Time
      Some notes.
      START: Time...
      Some more notes.

    Where `startTime - *` indicates a session in progress (needs to be ended.)

- A tip message at the top of the file where users submit there entry that gets automatically removed when saved.
  It would explain what the purpose of the opened buffer is for. (Ex. "Enter your journal entry below :")
- Option to add entries via Cli (rather than a temporary file).
  This has use case for automated journaling

- Ability to specify another time for the journal entry (Ex. `yesterday: Did something important.`)
- Templates. Specify a template format for a journal entry
- Filter on time as well as tags
- Filter on entry content (does it contain a certain phrase or regex)
- Exclusion filter
- Modification commands (edit, delete, etc.) that respect a searh.
  I.e., edit only entries searched for from the given filters.
- A "brief" option for displaying journal entries (just shows title or something?)

Bugs / Issues :
  - Viewing entries in a buffer `view tag1 tag2 --editor` doesn't display time in correct timezone (it's just in UTC)
